QUESTION 1

How do TCP and UDP differ in the way that they establish a connection between two endpoints?

A. TCP uses the three-way handshake, and UDP does not guarantee message delivery.

B. TCP uses synchronization packets, and UDP uses acknowledgment packets.

C. UDP provides reliable message transfer, and TCP is a connectionless protocol.

D. UDP uses SYN, SYN ACK, and FIN bits in the frame header while TCP uses SYN, SYN ACK, and ACK bits.

Correct Answer: A


QUESTION 2
What is the default behavior of a Layer 2 switch when a frame with an unknown destination MAC address is received?

A.The Layer 2 switch forwards the packet and adds the destination MAC address to its MAC address table.

B.The Layer 2 switch sends a copy of a packet to CPU for destination MAC address learning.

C.The Layer 2 switch floods packets to all ports except the receiving port in the given VLAN.

D.The Layer 2 switch drops the received frame.

Correct Answer: C


QUESTION 3

A. interface e0/0
description to XX-AXXX:XXKXX
ip address 10.2.1.3 255.255.255.252

B. interface e0/0
description to XX-AXXX:XXKXX
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.248

C. interface e0/0
description to XX-AXXX:XXKXX
ip address 172.16.1.4 255.255.255.248

D. interface e0/0

description to XX-AXXX:XXKXX
ip address 209.165.201.2 225.255.255.252

Correct Answer:D


QUESTION 4
What occurs to frames during the process of frame flooding?

A.Frames are sent to all ports, including those that are assigned to other VLANs.

B.Frames are sent to every port on the switch that has a matching entry in MAC address table.

C.Frames are sent to every port on the switch in the same VLAN except from the originating port.

D.Frames are sent to every port on the switch in the same VLAN.

Correct Answer:C

QUESTION 5
Which function does the range of private IPv4 addresses perform?

A.allows multiple companies to each use the same addresses without conflicts

B.provides a direct connection for hosts from outside of the enterprise network

C.ensures that NAT is not required to reach the Internet with private range addressing

D.enables secure communications to the Internet for all external hosts

Correct Answer: C

QUESTION 6
How do TCP and UDP differ in the way they provide reliability for delivery of packets?

A. TCP does not guarantee delivery or error checking to ensure that there is no corruption of data, UDP provides message acknowledgement and retransmits data if lost.

B. TCP provides flow control to avoid overwhelming a receiver by sending too many packets at once, UDP sends packets to the receiver in a continuous stream without checking.

C. TCP is a connectionless protocol that does not provide reliable delivery of data; UDP is a connection-oriented protocol that uses sequencing to provide reliable delivery.

D. TCP uses windowing to deliver packets reliably; UDP provides reliable message transfer between hosts by establishing a three-way handshake.

Correct Answer:B

QUESTION 7
What are two descriptions of three-tier network topologies? (Choose two.)

A. The distribution layer runs Layer 2 and Layer 3 technologies

B. The network core is designed to maintain continuous connectivity when devices fail

C. The access layer manages routing between devices in different domains

D. The core layer maintains wired connections for each host

E. The core and distribution layers perform the same functions

Correct Answer:A & B 

QUESTION 8

The SW1 interface g0/1 is in the down/down state. Which two configurations are valid reasons for the interface condition? (Choose two.)

A. There is a protocol mismatch

B. There is a duplex mismatch

C. The interface is shut down

D. The interface is error-disabled

E. There is a speed mismatch

Correct Answer: C & D




 QUESTION 9
What are two roles of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)? (Choose two.)

A.The DHCP server assigns IP addresses without requiring the client to renew them.

B.The DHCP server leases client IP addresses dynamically.

C.The DHCP client can request up to four DNS server addresses.

D.The DHCP server offers the ability to exclude specific IP addresses from a pool of IP addresses.

E.The DHCP client maintains a pool of IP addresses it can assign.

Correct Answer:B & D
